            <p align="left" class="TitleColor"> <span class="style1"><strong> What is an eMortgage? </strong></span> : An eMortgage (electronic mortgage) is a mortgage for which the promissory note and possibly
                other documents (such as the security instrument and loan application) are created and stored
                electronically rather than by using traditional paper documentation that has a pen and ink
                signature. Because of the limited number of recording jurisdictions that accept electronic
                documents for recordation, most (but not all) eMortgages typically consist of a paper security
                instrument and an electronic note (eNote). </p>
            <hr>
            <p align="left"><span class="style1"><strong>What is the legal basis for eMortgages?</strong></span> :
                The legal basis for eMortgages was established with the Electronic Signatures in Global and
                National Commerce Act (E-SIGN), enacted by Congress on June 30, 2000. Also, most states
                have adopted laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), a model for state
                statutes that was developed in 1999 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform
                State Laws. These laws prompted development of a legal infrastructure to support the creation
                of valid, enforceable, and transferable eMortgages, provided they comply with state and federal
                statutes governing electronic loan obligations and mortgage lending.</p>
            <hr>
            <p align="left"><span class="style1"><strong>Does CFS purchase eMortgages?</strong></span> : Yes. CFS regards eMortgages as part of our normal business operations and is now
                purchasing eMortgages nearly every day. We are actively purchasing eMortgages that meet our
                published guidelines ? through both whole loans and MBS executions. We purchased the first
                two eMortgages on the secondary market in 2000, and published a broad set of delivery
                guidelines in June 2002. Our updated guidelines and specifications are detailed in our Guide to
                Delivering eMortgage Loans to CFS, available on the eMortgage Delivery page of
                Carnegie Financial Services.</p>
            <hr>
            <p align="left"><span class="style1"><strong>How are eMortgages serviced?</strong></span> : Generally, CFS standard servicing requirements apply when servicing eMortgage
                loans. In addition, servicers must identify their eMortgages on their servicing systems. Servicers
                must have the capability to update the MERS eRegistry to record any payoff, charge-off, loan
                modification, or assumption. Prior to transferring servicing portfolios that contain eMortgages,
                the transferor servicer must ensure that the transferee servicer knows that there are
                eMortgages in the portfolio and is ready and able to service them. In the event of a foreclosure,
                there are special loss mitigation procedures servicers must follow, such as contacting their
                CFS Servicing Consultant and working with our designated attorneys.</p>
